# ZFC Axioms:

\theorem{When you consider a _project website_, you **must** define a `prepath` variable in your `config.md` with the name of that project. For instance: `@def prepath = "myWebsite"`.
  This is used upon deployment to indicate that the base URL of your website is `username.github.io/myWebsite/` instead of `username.github.io`.
  If you forget to do that, among other problems the CSS won't load and your website will look terrible ðŸ˜…. 
  
  However, if you add a custom domain like `example.com` to your *project* repo like `myWebsite`, then the variable `prepath` should be set an empty string to make the CSS work.}
