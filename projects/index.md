# Projects:  

> Some of the projects that I have built are: 

* [MathematicalToolkit](https://github.com/NisharArjyal/MathematicalToolkit): A forward-mode automatic differentiation tool that is based on operator overloading in C++ plus a fast tensor library for vector forward mode AD. 
\\
* **GNODE**: (wip) A fast parallel graph library in Rust for efficient numerical computation supposed to form the base layer to build a Graph Deep Learning library on top with GPU based convolutions/stencil operations for GCN's.

* **Blocker**: (wip) A simple blockchain application written in Python. This is more of a proof of concepts application.
