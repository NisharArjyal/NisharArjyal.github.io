# Projects:  

> Some of the projects that I have built are: 

* [MathematicalToolkit](https://github.com/NisharArjyal/MathematicalToolkit): A forward-mode automatic differentiation tool that is based on operator overloading in C++ plus a fast tensor library for vector forward mode AD. 
\\
* [Blocker](https://github.com/pramishp/blockchain_from_scratch): (wip) A simple blockchain application written in Python. This is more of a proof of concepts application.
\\
* Geocold: This is a vulkan based simple ray tracing engine written in the Rust programming language using the Vulkan api. For now, it is a work in progress.
\\
* DiffRay.jl: This project is a part of my 3rd year engineering project. It is a CUDA accelerated differentiable path tracer written in Julia.
\\
* DigitalSignalProcessing: This is a fast signal processing library written in raw C. It is threaded, SIMD accelerated and what not.
