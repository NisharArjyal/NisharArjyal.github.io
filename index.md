My name is Nishar Arjyal and I am currently a third year Computer Engineering student 
at [Pulchowk Engineering Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Kathmandu.
\\
\\
My interests are in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and its applications to Science and Engineering. 
\\
\\
I generally program in Julia and Rust where I mostly build software that is related to fields
like high performance computing, parallel SIMD vectorized coding, compilers, neural networks,
numerical software, differential equations and what not. 
\\
\\
Some of my skills include high performance programming in Julia, programming in C++, C, Python,
Rust, and hopefully I can learn Haskell too in the future.

I am familiar with the RISC-V instruction set and now I am checking out the x86 instruction set,
alongside the LLVM-IR both of which are essential to understand for writing high performance 
numerical code.
