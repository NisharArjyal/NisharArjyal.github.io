Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am Nishar Arjyal and I am an ex Computer Engineering 
student from the [Pulchowk Engineering Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Kathmandu.
This is my blog and in this blog, we talk about computing, science,
engineering, politics and basically everything there is in life.
\\
\\
My interests are in all things science and scientific computing, particularly 
with the booming field of scientific machine learning.
\\
\\
My programming languages of interests are Rust, C++, C, Julia and Python.
\\
\\
Some of my skills include GPU programming for computer graphics using 
OpenGL and Vulkan APIs in C++ and Rust. I am also a longtime Julia programmer
where I write most of my code. I am reasonably good at GPU 
programming using CUDA C++ (or so I would like to think).
\\
\\
Please do check out my blog up top and if you have any comments to leave, 
you are invited [here](https://github.com/NisharArjyal/NisharArjyal.github.io/issues).
