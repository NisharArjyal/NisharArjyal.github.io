Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am Nishar Arjyal and I am a former Computer Engineering 
student from the [Pulchowk Engineering Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Kathmandu.
In this blog, we talk about science, mathematics, computers, politics and everything else.

\\

I am currently studying pure mathematics with a focus on mathematical analysis and 
differential equations. I am also interested in applied mathematics and use Julia primarily 
for writing code. Having a computer engineering background I am also very fond of Rust for writing software.

Please do check out my blog up top and if you have any comments to leave, 
you are invited [here](https://github.com/NisharArjyal/NisharArjyal.github.io/issues).

Here's a [short CV]() of mine.
